# This is the SINGLE env file. Change NETWORK= to switch environments.
# Account names, RPC URLs, and contract IDs are derived from NETWORK
# (in Makefile/variables.mk and gateway/src/config/index.ts).
#
# Secrets are auto-loaded from Google Secret Manager at dev startup.
# In production (Docker), secrets are passed as env vars directly.

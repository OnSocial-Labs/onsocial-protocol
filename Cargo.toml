# OnSocial Protocol - Workspace Cargo.toml
#
# This file centralizes all dependency versions for the monorepo. Each contract
# (auth-onsocial, ft-wrapper-onsocial, relayer-onsocial, marketplace-onsocial,
# staking-onsocial, social-onsocial) and the tests crate reference only the
# dependencies they need using `workspace = true` in their Cargo.toml.
#
# Dependency Usage:
# - auth-onsocial: near-sdk, near-sdk-macros, borsh, serde
# - ft-wrapper-onsocial: near-sdk, near-sdk-macros, borsh, serde
# - relayer-onsocial: near-sdk, near-sdk-macros, borsh, serde, near-crypto,
#                     ed25519-dalek, getrandom, hex, base64
# - marketplace-onsocial: near-sdk, near-sdk-macros, borsh, serde
# - staking-onsocial: near-sdk, near-sdk-macros, borsh, serde
# - social-onsocial: near-sdk, near-sdk-macros, borsh, serde
# - tests: near-sdk, near-workspaces, near-crypto, tokio, anyhow, serde_json
#
# Note: near-sdk with `unit-testing` feature is used in [dev-dependencies] for
# unit tests in auth-onsocial, ft-wrapper-onsocial, and relayer-onsocial.
#
# When adding a new contract or updating tests, reference the required dependencies
# in their Cargo.toml and update the documentation here to reflect usage.
